## How to Contribute

Contributions to Viehub can be made in various forms, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code updates. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the issue with specific details to help us replicate the problem.
- Suggest a step-by-step reproduction method if applicable.
- Explain the behavior you observed after following the steps and what you expected to happen.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Include examples to illustrate how the enhancement would function ideally.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to Viehub users and the broader community.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Viehub? You can start by looking through the `beginner` and `help-wanted` tags in our issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are great for getting started.

## Development Setup

Please follow the steps in our README.md to set up your development environment. Once you have set up and tested your development environment, you are ready to contribute and send your fixes or enhancements to Viehub.
