Our platform enables hosts to create contests and participants to compete for predetermined prizes, fostering innovation and collaboration across various domains.

## Description

Viehub serves as a collaborative arena where creativity meets opportunity. Designed to cater to both individuals and organizations, the platform allows users to host contests with specific challenges and participants to showcase their skills by submitting solutions. This not only stimulates a competitive environment but also nurtures a community geared towards technological advancement and problem-solving.

## Features

Viehub is built with a suite of features to enhance user experience and facilitate efficient interaction between contest hosts and participants:

- **Contest Creation**: Hosts can easily set up contests, define problem statements, and specify rewards.
- **Dynamic Participation**: Participants can browse through a list of contests, enroll in challenges, and submit their entries within the platform.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Both hosts and participants receive instant notifications about contest developments, ensuring they are always in the loop.
- **Integrated Judging**: A built-in mechanism for evaluating submissions that allows for fair and transparent judging processes.
- **Community Engagement**: Features forums and discussion boards where users can connect, share insights, and foster collaborations.

## Project Structure

Viehub is thoughtfully organized into client and server directories, simplifying development and ensuring clean separation of concerns:

```plaintext
/
    /client     # Contains all client-side code and resources
    /server     # Hosts server-side application code and APIs
```

## Getting Started

Set up your development environment by following these detailed steps for both the client and server components of Viehub.

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm for client-side development.
- Python and Poetry for server-side scripting.
- Availability of ports 8000 for backend and 3000 for frontend.

### Setup Environment

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` in both `/server` and `/client` directories and adjust the settings to fit your local or deployment environments.

### Start Development Server

#### Backend with Poetry

Navigate to the `/server` directory for backend setup:

- **Install Poetry**: Follow installation guidelines on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
- **Add dependencies**: Use `poetry add <dependency-name>` to include new packages.
- **Launch the backend server**:
    ```bash
    poetry run start
    ```

#### Frontend with npm

For the frontend, proceed to the `/client` directory:

- **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to bring in necessary packages.
- **Fire up the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will activate the frontend development server, typically on port 3000, facilitating live updates for a smooth coding experience.

### Production Server

Ensure that your `.env` files in both `/server` and `/client` are configured for production settings. Deployment specifics will depend on your hosting solution, possibly requiring additional steps such as building the frontend with `npm run build`.
